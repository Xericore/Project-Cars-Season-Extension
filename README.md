# Project Cars Season Extension

Project Cars Season Extension is a standalone windows application written with C# and WPF. It's designed for different users competing with each other on the same PC. Imagine you have a racing rig in a shared space like an office. Most users don't have their own Project Cars or Steam account.
Here's where the Project Cars Season Extension comes into play. It allows users to easily race against each other, just with a few mouse clicks. Your PC doesn't even have to be connected to the internet.

# Features
* Create seasons for each player to enjoy
* Each season can contain multiple races
* Each race consists of one track and car combination
* Players compete for the fastest lap on the same PC (e.g. racing rig)

# Project Cars 2 compatibility
Project Cars Season Extension is also compatible with Project Cars 2. You will however have to set the API compatibility to Project Cars 1 in the settings. Furthermore, the images for the cars and tracks are all tailored for Project Cars 1. The app will work and images will also diplay, but you will not get the same images as in Project Cars 2. You can change this however even without having to recompile the code. All you have to do is place the images with the track or carname into the Assets folder. They will be loaded dynamically.
